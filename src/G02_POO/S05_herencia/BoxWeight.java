          Box. This still invokes the constructor Box(Box ob). Remember, a

          Thus, we are able to pass a BoxWeight object to the Box constructor. Of
          course, Box only has knowledge of its own members.
        - If super( ) is not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of each
          superclass will be executed.
